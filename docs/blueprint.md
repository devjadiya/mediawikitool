## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant reddish-purple (#9400D3) to represent the creativity and scientific discovery at the heart of the competition.
- Background color: A very light lilac (#F5EEF8), close to white, for a clean and non-distracting backdrop that highlights the images.
- Accent color: A slightly lighter shade of purple that trends toward violet (#B048B5) will act as a secondary accent, differentiating related elements from each other.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif font, with personality aligned to art and design.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' serif font for body text, for an elegant and contemporary feel.
- Use clear and accessible icons to represent different sections and categories. Consider using icons from Wikimedia's own design language for consistency.
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout that focuses on the images. Implement a grid-based system for displaying images and information clearly.
- Subtle animations can be used when transitioning between images or sections, providing a smooth user experience. Avoid overly flashy or distracting animations.
